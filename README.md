# Intellidwell Sprinkler Controller Firmware

This repository contains the open-source firmware for the **Intellidwell ESP32-Based Smart Sprinkler Controller**, developed by Tanner Nelson. It is designed to run on ESP32 microcontrollers and provides an intuitive web-based interface, scheduling features, MQTT integration, and support for multiple zones and rain delay logic.

This code powers the official Intellidwell controller hardware, which is available for purchase. It is released for educational purposes, hobbyists, and developers who wish to contribute to or adapt the project for **personal** and **non-commercial** use.
